## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorites because it was my first time writing and running a c++ program. I gained knowledge about printing text on the screen and using #include iostream. It showed me that programming can be simple to start with and still feel exciting. I became more at ease using the compiler and writing code thanks to this lab. 

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was fun because I got to create a madlib story using the words I entered. I learned how to use variables, user input, and basic string handling. It showed me how a program can interact with the user and change based on what they type. This lab helped me practice thinking about the order of steps in a program. 

* Lab 3

    This was my favorite lab because it felt more like actual problem-solving. I learned how to write functions, pass arguments, and return calculated values. It also taught me how to break bigger tasks into smaller pieces of code. During this lab made me feel more confident in understanding how programs actually work behind the scenes.
